 <h1>HTB Feline</h1>
 <p>
 	<img src="images/feline/feline.PNG" alt="feline" class="inline"/> 								<br/> <br/> <br/>
	 
	 We start out with the usual nmap scan 												<br/> <br/>
	<img src="images/feline/nmap.PNG" alt="nmap" class="inline"/> 									<br/> <br/> <br/>
	 
	 The host is running apache tomcat 9.0.27 which is quite old, according to the apache site this was released back in 2019	<br/> <br/>
	 <img src="images/feline/tomcat-release.PNG" alt="tomcat release" class="inline"/> 						<br/> <br/> <br/>
	 
	 The site is a mostly dead install with dummy links, but there is a VirusBucket section to upload file samples			<br/> <br/>
	 <img src="images/feline/web-server.PNG" alt="web page" class="inline"/> 							<br/> <br/> <br/>
	 
	 I uploaded a sample and checkout the request in burp										<br/> <br/>
	 <img src="images/feline/burp-upload.PNG" alt="burpsuite upload request" class="inline"/> 					<br/> <br/> <br/>
	 
	 We can see that its passing the email and filename in headers, and passing the file as an image. We can also 			<br/>
	 see that the requests are sent to /upload.jsp to be evaluated.									<br/> <br/>
	 
	 Some digging into tomcat 9.0.27 revealed this is potentially vulnerable to a deserialization attack (CVE-2020-9484)		<br/> <br/>
	 <img src="images/feline/apache-vuln.PNG" alt="tomcat vuln" class="inline"/> 							<br/> <br/> <br/>
	 
	 <a href="https://github.com/masahiro331/CVE-2020-9484">There is a poc linked in several of the cve info pages</a> <br/> <br/>
	 <img src="images/feline/gh-poc.PNG" alt="POC exploit" class="inline"/> 							<br/> <br/> <br/>
	 
	 I attempted to run this to see if this apache tomcat install appears vulnerable. I was able to succesfully upload the 		<br/>
	 groovy session, but unable to trigger the stack traceback. 									<br/> <br/>
	 <img src="images/feline/user-1st-try.PNG" alt="POC exploit" class="inline"/> 							<br/> <br/> <br/>
	 
	 I started thinking that this was because of the upload path. The POC shows the default upload path to be			<br/>
	 <b>/usr/local/tomcat/</b> though we have not confirmed this on our instance. I started playing around with uploads		<br/>
	 via curl. After passing an empty filename, along with a valid image I was able to trigger a stacktraceback that 		<br/>
	 revealed the upload path to us.												<br/> <br/>
	 <img src="images/feline/upload-location.PNG" alt="POC exploit" class="inline"/> 						<br/> <br/> <br/>
	 
	 Now can try to rerun the earlier POC exploit with our updated path <b>(/opt/samples/uploads/)</b>				<br/> 
	 And we are able to see the full stack traceback as expected, thus confirming this vulnerability.				<br/> <br/> 
	 <img src="images/feline/poc-confirmed.PNG" alt="POC exploit" class="inline"/> 							<br/> <br/> <br/>
