        		<h1>HackTheBox Remote Writeup</h1>
				<p> One of my favorite past times has turned into solving boxes over on hackthebox.eu.<br/> 
					This writeup is for an easy box by the name of remote, that had quite a few good lessons involved.<br/> <br/>

					We start out with the usual nmap scan <br/> <br/>
					
					<img src="images/nmap.png" alt="nmap" class="inline"/> <br/>
					
					Points of interest here are that we have anonymous FTP access, a web server, and some nfs shares. <br/> <br/>
					FTP was a dead end with nothing inside. And on the website we have a dummy Umbraco install. <br/> <br/>
					
					<img src="images/web.PNG" alt="umbraco" class="inline"/> <br/> <br/> <br/>
					
					The webserver was pretty boring with not a whole lot going on. So I decided to checkout the nfs shares. <br/> <br/>
					
					<img src="images/mounts.PNG" alt="nfs" class="inline"/> <br/> <br/> <br/>
					
					We can see we have a site_backups share that is accessible. So I copied it over to kali to check it out. <br/> <br/>
					
					<img src="images/nfs-backup.PNG" alt="nfs" class="inline"/> <br/> <br/> <br/>
					
					Some research into Umbraco showed that it stores its database in a .sdf file inside the App_Data directory. <br/>
					We can pull out the admin username and hash with a simple grep command. <br/> <br/>
					
					<img src="images/hash.PNG" alt="hash" class="inline"/> <br/> <br/> <br/>
					
					This hash is easily crackable with something like JohnTheRipper. I threw it at the rockyou.txt wordlist and we get <br/> <br/>
					
					<b> admin@htb.local : baconandcheese </b>
